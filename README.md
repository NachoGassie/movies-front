## Getting Started
First, get the api:

Go to https://github.com/NachoGassie/movies_api to clone the api. You will have to import the MySqlDb and change the branch to <local>
To login you can use email: user@user.com - password: contrase√±a
(this project is yet to be deployed and therefore it only uses a local api and db for now)

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
